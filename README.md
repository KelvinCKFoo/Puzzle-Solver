1, The final2.py consist of a Klotski game in 2 configuration including Standard Klotski and Variant Klotski, which looks the same but the tile sequence are different, this can be changed at line 84

2, There are 3 algorithmic Klotski solver including BFS, DFS and A* with manhattan distance, which allows the user to choose which algorithm to use as the solver by umcommenting the wanted algorithm at line 248

3, Once the python starts running, the selected algorithm starts to solve the selected variant of Klotski. Sometime the window can turn black and unresponsive, but after finding the solution the window will display the puzz;e along with the solve button

4, Pressing the solve button can visualize the solution found by the algorithm.
