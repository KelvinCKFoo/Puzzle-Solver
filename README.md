The final2.py consist of a Klotski game in 2 configuration including Standard Klotski and Variant Klotski which can be changed at line 84

There are 3 algorithmic Klotski solver including BFS, DFS and A* with manhattan distance, which allows the user to choose which algorithm to use as the solver by umcommenting the wanted algorithm

Once the python starts running, the selected algorithm started to solve the selected variant of Klotski. Sometime the window can turn black and unresponsive, but after finding the solution the window will display to tiles along with the solve button

Pressing the solve button can visualize the solution found by the algorithm.
